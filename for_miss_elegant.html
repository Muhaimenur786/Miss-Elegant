    <h1>For Miss Elegant</h1>

    <p>Hey you,</p>

    <p>
      You always had that quiet magic — the kind that walks into a room and fills it with softness without making a sound. 
      I call you "Miss Elegant" not just for how you move, but for how your heart seems to hold galaxies.
    </p>

    <p>
      I don’t know what the future holds. But I do believe in the power of <em>dua</em> — in that sacred whisper between the broken heart and the One who hears all. 
      Even when everything seems impossible, I still believe. Because... <span class="dua-line">He is Ar-Rahman, Al-Mujib.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      You see, this isn’t just about feelings. It’s about faith. About placing my heart in the safest place I know — His hands.
    </p>

    <p class="flirty">
      I make dua for you. Not just because I adore you. But because I care. Deeply. Softly. Unshakably. I ask for your peace, your strength, your nearness to Him — even when I’m not near.
    </p>

    <p>
      I never asked you to wait for me. Or love me back. I only asked <strong>Allah</strong>. And I left my heart with Him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even if you don’t reply — just smile. Somewhere, someone is still raising their hands in <em>sujood</em>... and you're there in that prayer.
    </p>

      <p><strong>Something I once wrote for my future self:</strong></p>
      <p>
        <em>
        "How can I not believe if He is Ar-Rahman?<br/>
        How can I not trust if He is Al-Mujib?<br/>
        Allah accepted the dua of Iblis after his disobedience…<br/>
        How could He not accept the tears of someone who calls upon Him in the night,<br/>
        with nothing but a broken heart and unshakable hope?"
        </em>
